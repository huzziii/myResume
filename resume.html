			<p> Umaer Ahmed is a 3rd year electrical engineering student at Carleton University. Unfortunately this guy's been struggling since day one. I told him umpteenth time that engineering is not for you: you're better off working at WIND and make $$ without having to worry about these bullshit engineering courses. But no.. this guy won't listen to me. Maybe cause he thinks he's just too good for that shit. 
			Recently, this nigga uploaded his first ever picture on facebook. Haven't checked the number of likes he got but surely would have gotten more than 100.. and I wouldn't be surprised to see that alot of chicks have liked his photo..  </p>
